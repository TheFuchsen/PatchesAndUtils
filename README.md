From time to time I have to write quick or very specific tools. I'll be dumping these here.

## Leukopatch

Have you ever read this in your Maya?:

Warning：你的文件贼健康～我就说一声没有别的意思"

Well, this is a virus that was intended to eliminate the leukocyte maya trojan, but went out of control and infected everyone else. Maya has updated their Security Tools to patch this, but bugs out on references and cannot really patch all circumstances. This tool can clean your scene and maya itself witouth disrupting your workflow.

Just drag and drop the .py file into the main maya window with the infected scene open.
